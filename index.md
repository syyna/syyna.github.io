This blog is mostly becuase I was getting sick of all the reviews I write ending up in varoius repositories that I myself forget about.  For example, I review books in Goodreads, games in Steam, and movies on a piece of text file.  I sometimes forget where I wrote what, and this is mostly just an index of what I'm doing.

The reviews will still be mostly hyperlinks to the actual review sites, but this way I can actually find stuff again!

Yay! Huzzah! And no value was lost! =)
