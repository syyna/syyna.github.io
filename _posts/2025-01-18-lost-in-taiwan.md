# Lost in Taiwan
[Goodreads Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7230156654)

I picked this up on a whim at the library, and having been to Taiwan more times in the last decade than any other foreign destination, the title definitely piqued my interest.

This is more of a love letter from the author to Taiwan, as it mostly shows the breadth of what the country has to offer in a little pastiche. The main character, the younger brother of an English teacher in Taiwan, has an adventure in the last 48 hours of his stay in Taiwan. Sent out by his friend to find a video game console, he loses his phone and therefore his way back to his brother's apartment. He then meets an incredibly cool girl that guides him back and gives him a crash course in Taiwanese culture.

Really convenient...but definitely not the way it'd play out in real life. She'd at most get him to the police station and then leave him there. thats most any culture. ;p

Anyway, that's not much to say other than, its probably a book the author wanted to get out of his system. I wouldn't really recommend it as the story is a bit cliche, and its mostly a vehicle to get the authors love of Taiwan out.
