# Silent Night
[Letterboxd Review](https://letterboxd.com/usagichann1/film/silent-night-2023-1/)

Another movie that i only watch because I'm on a plane.  This is a John Woo produced film that is best described as a John Woo movie distilled into its purest essence.  There is 0 dialouge in the film, and you can pretty much say this is the type of arthouse project that film students would love to make if they could find someone to bankroll them.

Outside of that conceit, the movie is a pretty predictable tale of revenge.  It really shows how you don't really need much of a plot in an action gun-fu film and how the purest essence of it is mostly just a motive, a training montage, and then the action finale.

The main character is probably one of the most realistic anti-heroes in that they show him puking after killing his first victim, but in typical heroic antic, stands  right back up and gets right back to the killing.  

Its not a bad film, and there are some feels.  the motive is well established, and the action is satisfying.  I'd say the lack of dialuge makes it interesting and refreshing enough to include in whatever art film course someone is taking, but outside of that type of discussion, the film never quite aspires to the heights it has the potential for.  

Still, interesting enough to watch once.
