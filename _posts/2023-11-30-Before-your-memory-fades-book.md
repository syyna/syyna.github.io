# Before your memory Fades
[Goodreads Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5987062727)

Book 3 is slightly better than book 2 of this series, but I'm going to stop here because the premise evantually just got old. I wish the author would have thought of more innovative scenarios, but in the end, its always someone going back in time to fix some problems or attain resolution.

Its sweet, but really just a one note trick that gets old after a while (you can also only eat so many donuts before you stop feeling the sweetness).

The stories are mostly in the same veins as books 1 and 2, and honestly I feel like if you enjoyed the first book, just STOP there and forget that the author wrote 2 other books that are very samey and probably a 4th that's just as samey.

If there were more resolution of the characters or more development beyond "this person married and has a kid and now her power is gone and passed on to her kid", i might say sure, read on, but otherwise...pass.
