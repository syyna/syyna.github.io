[ggapp Review](https://ggapp.io/null/reviews/warhammer-40-000-darktide/RP_ZiGCs)

I got this as part of the humble bundle from November or some such, and not having played a FPS for at least a year, I thought I'd bounce off it pretty hard.  Boy was I wrong.  The last time I played a horde shooter was sometime when Left 4 Dead 2 came out, and this brought me back to those days pretty fast.

Simply put, its one of the best horde shooter games with an emphasis on Melee.  There's 5 difficulties, 4 characters, a very well developed skill tree and more weapons and builds than you can throw a stick at.  Not all options are viable at the highest level of play, but given that this is a PvE game, its not the detriment that you think it is.

This is the one game that's consumed my life since I got it, and I haven't been this hooked into a game for a long time.  Its got the best beats of a co-op shooter, a great FPS melee system (i'm not sure if its the best or not, but its damn close), compelling asthetics from the 40k world, and awesome music.

When a team works together and gets to the end, whether its by the skin of their teeth, or a relatively smooth cakewalk, there's always a sense of achivement, and that is really the reason I keep coming back.

Game is awesome, and if you're into the L4D genre, then this is a mustplay.

Highly recommended.
