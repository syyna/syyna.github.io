# Dune - Part 2 (2024)
[Letterboxd Review](https://letterboxd.com/usagichann1/film/dune-part-two/)

This being a back to back watch from Dune: Part One, was a fast continuation from the first movie.  The movie basically picks up from where the last movie left off, and you have the continued stories of the Director's vision.

Its still interesting and enthralling, but this is where you can start criticizing the world that Frank Herbert built.  You see the protagonist grow more confident in his powers, you see his new evil rival, you see the machinations of the rest of the universe. 

Its still hauntingly beautiful, and the actors and everyone behind them deliver in spades, but its still a poor allegory of the world.  

Its still absolutely worth watching but at the same time you realize its such a poor substitute for what our world is going through in 2024.

Highly recommended if you've watched the first one, and if you haven't seen the first one, go and watch it.  You won't regret the 3 hours you spend.
