# Minecraft Movie
[LetterboxD Review](https://letterboxd.com/usagichann1/film/a-minecraft-movie/)

My kids are really into minecraft, though the older one has sort of aged out of it. The younger one is really into minecraft, so of course, when this came out on streaming, we had to watch it.

The trailers contained almost all the good parts of the film, so if you're a film aficionado, I'd say don't bother with this film. They tie various story elements to the game relatively decently, but all the humans are humans in the minecraft world, and the monsters and such are....blocky and cutesy. Its a kid film, so I don't really begrudge it much, but its still a bit jarring.

The plot is....best not to talk about it. this is a fan service movie through and through and everythign is about getting the maximum number of feels about minecraft to all the fans. It makes for a lousy movie and even the kid was bored by the middle. There are a few catchy jack black songs, but it just feels so phoned it. I'm giving this 2* becuase if you can't capture a 6 year old minecraft fan, i'm not sure who this movie is for.
