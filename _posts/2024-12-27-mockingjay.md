# Mockingjay
[Goodreads Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7127443674)

Book 3 of the Hunger Games. At this point, i'm reading this book only because the 2nd book ended on a cliffhanger. Now with the books being so bad (in my opinion), why would I torture myself further? Call it a mascochist streak, call it a completionist streak, call it whatever, but I might as well finish it. Part of grit is doing stuff you don't particularly enjoy, even when its unnecessary. =)

Anyway, the 3rd book starts off with the end of the 2nd book with katniss being rescued from the arena after a lot of contriving about who are and who aren't allies in the quelling between victors. The reasoning given for why everyone was out to save her in the 2nd book is once again, contrived and ridiculous.

Seriously, the entire book barely has a veneer of logic and continuity to it and the characters are badly written. Most of them are one dimensional, and once again I feel its insulting to anyone above a 2nd grade reading level. Even kindergarteners know there are shades of morality in life and the events and characters in this book belies all of that.

There's quite a bit of combat in this book, but a lot of it is once again really given short shrift. Partly becuase its all written from the POV of Katniss, so you don't see much beyond what she sees, but the way the fights play out are all ridiculous and there's barely any tactics.

I did finish the book and was releived once I did. Once again, i can heartily recommend skipping all of the books, but if you do have to get the zeitgeist, then you can read the first one.
