# Night Eaters Vol3: Their Kingdom Come
[Goodreads Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7505096952)

The conclusion to the Night Eaters trilogy. I have to say this is the weakest portion of the trilogy, but still a very good read. I think it mostly feels weak because the actual climax was anti-climatic. A bit predictable in the sense that the protagonists and antagonists won't just fight in a marvel super hero movie style fight, but in that there's probably no fight that can bring satisfaction after all the things that the characters have been through.

The best part of the book was the authoress's writing about how this whole series came to be, and the whole thing clicked for me. Book 1 is about your typical asian household and all the expectations that mom and dad have for their kids, book 2 is about the kids coming into their own and finding out how secrets can be bad for the family even if the parents think its about protecting the kids, and book 3 is about passing on legacies.

All in all, read the whole series, especially if you grew up with asian parents. Its really made for the tween generation of those stuck with 1st generation parents and having to deal with the dichotomy of living with the past generation's expectations, and the host countries way of dealing with life.
