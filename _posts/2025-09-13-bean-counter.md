# The Other World's Books Depend on the Bean Counter
[Goodreads Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7930556715)

Picked up the first 4 volumes of this at the library and was intrigued enough to finish all 4 volumes in one setting. Like many other manga, this series started off as a light novel and actually had enough legs to get turned into a manga and into an anime.

Basically an accountant in a japanese company was teleported (along with a shrine maiden, also from Japan) to another world. The main target of the teleportation spell was the shrine maiden, from which they expect her to save them from a magic blight that only she's capable of curing. The accountant was unexpected, but they treat him well by making sure he's fed, clothed, and housed. He unexpectedly asks for work (no language issues in spoken or written....apparently the magic makes sure everyone is understood) and not knowing what else to do, they acede to his wishes and gives him an accounting job.

He promptly finds out that his department does not use GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) and just rubber stamps expense and budgets provided from other departments. For a magic kingdom, having anything other than a treasury (not an accounting department, they are very different thing) is ludicrous but oh well, I guess if you accept that a world has magic, its not so hard to imagine it has an accounting department. =)

Anyway, there is romance in the book, there is some light action, there is a lot of light accounting burecracy and there's this metoric rise of a person who was at best middling at his job in the real world but really hits it off and saves the finances and other things in a fantasy world.

I think this is one of those fantasies you have in high school or middle school. Where you're just an ordinary person in the real world, but transport you to an alternate world, and you're really a hero. You get to be loved and valued and all that, but its too hard in the real world.

Its a bit scary how I recognize these fantasies mostly becuase I know i used to have them. Boring geometry class, what it this demon pops up and starts terrorizing everyone? I know what to do becuase i read about how to banish demons in last nights fantasy novel, so I'd get to save the world!!!

yah. its exactly like that. =) anyway, good thing to take your minds off the real world, much needed fantasy, but don't go into it expecting more than that hoenstly. 3* =)
