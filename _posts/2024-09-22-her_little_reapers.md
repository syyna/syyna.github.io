# The Night Eaters (vol 2): Her Little Reapers
[Goodreads Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6842599077)

Following up to the first book of the Trilogy, the Night Eaters goes off on more merry adventures of the Tang twins. More family dysfunction, you think tiger moms are bad, how about if your mom is a LITERAL DRAGON....the uncles you know and love are also in cahoots with your parents to keep you guys in the dark, and you know the usual parental trope. WE DID ALL THIS BECAUSE WE LOVE YOU.

You have to love a series that goes into so much of the human dysfunctions we get in asian (and probably non-asian) families. There's the usual blood and gore, and the usual demonic cults and a lot of semi-horror things that happens (ghosts with holes in head....), and whats a lot of adventures if there's no betrayal?

You got it all, wrapped up in beautiful artwork. I've read the Authoress' work in prose before, and I think she's much better in the comic medium.

In any case, if you've read the first book, I can't imagine a situation where you don't read the second. You can read it for the occult elements, but seriously, you're probably reading it because you want to see more asian family dysfunctions. =)

Highly recommended.
