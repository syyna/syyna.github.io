# Everyone here is lying
[Goodreads Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6233894311)

This one was a boredom read. I was bored and it was the most interesting book available at my digital library. I thought it might be a mystery detective novel, but it turned out to just be a suburban thriller. You can't figure out the whoddunit, and you're just along for the ride.

You have a missing girl, an entire suburb full of people who want to sleep with each other, are sleeping with each other, or have slept with each other, and their respective families. You have a lot of motives, but no real leads. You have no character growth, which is understandable given that this takes place over 96 hours or so, but you do have a lot of ruined lives.

I'll put this in the category of "lives being ruined" disaster movie. Everyone's lives are ruined by the events that happens in the book and you don't get a good sense of the aftermath. No one gets away with anything, everyone gets their comeuppance.

Its a good 8 hour read and I'm not sure I liked it enough to recommend it, but if you're bored, it sure beats just watching the rain fall. =)
