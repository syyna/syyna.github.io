# Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom
[Letterboxd Review](https://letterboxd.com/usagichann1/film/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom/)

I actually came into this movie with super low expectations after watching The Flash, and its probably becuase of those low expectations that I thought this movie punched slightly ahead of its weight.  the plot is your standard super hero fare, black manta found a lost kingdom with its trident that promises him great power and revenge, blah blah blah.

So then starts the quest for aquaman to stop him from destroying the world and civilization as we know it.  For most of DC movies, the problem is that the heroes are so overpowered that its a constant "how do we make the characters so stupid that they don't just overpower and beat the villians in the first 2 minutes of the encounter", and there's a lot of stupidity going on here.

This is one area that DC has a hard time catching up with Marvel on, in that Marvel's characters are never so overpowered that the authors have to invent ridiculous plot holes for them to not succeed at first.

Anyhow, this movie works because Jason Mamoa has great screen presence and is not so serious that it makes the movie unwatchable.

Watch this if you need to burn a few hours on your flight, but otherwise save your watch times for something better.
