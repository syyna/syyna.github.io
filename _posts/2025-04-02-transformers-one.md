# Transformers One
[LetterboxD Review](https://letterboxd.com/usagichann1/film/transformers-one/)

I know I watched this earlier in the year, hence why I'm reviewing it, but I'm reviewing it at least 6 months past when I watched it, so forgive me if I lose some details.

This is basically the origin story of how Optimus Prime and Megatron came to be, its a retelling of the original origin story, but updated in such a way that its better. The older origin stories were told in the comics and TV series, so it was a product of its time. 

In this movie, you get introduced to Optimus Prime and Megatron as buddies. They are cogless robots, working in mines to get energon out. You never get told about why they're cogless, just that they are, and as cogless robots, they're a lower tier than the cogged robot, who CAN transform. They story goes on from there to how they get their cogs, how they meet bumblebee and elita-1, and how Megatron becomes Megatron and Orion Pax becomes Optimus Prime. There's nothing here that's revolutionary but everything is quite well done.

The voices have moved on from Peter cullen as Optimus Prime, and its now Chris Hemsworth (Thor), but he did such a good job that I didn't really notice (and frankly, I was never one of those who wax nostalgia about old voice actors. you're invested in the character, not the voice actors...). The soundtrack is..nothing to write home about, nothing as iconic as the original Transformer 1986 movie, but nothing offensive either.

All in all, me and the boy enjoyed it, although he's not wanting to watch it again like he sometimes do the 1986 one. 4*.
