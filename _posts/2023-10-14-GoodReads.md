# Sy's Goodreads Page
I mostly started reviewing stuff on Goodreads just to remind myself of what I read and how I felt about what I read.

I try not to spoil things in my reviews, hence its mostly a stream-of-conciousness type of review rather than a review that summarizes the hook points of a book.  My style changes mostly on my whims, hence its hard to get a sense of what I really care about.  This might change as I write more and try to be more consistent.

Anyhow, here's my [Goodreads page](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110819831-sy-na).
