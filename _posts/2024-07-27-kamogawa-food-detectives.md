# The Kamogawa Food Detectives
[Goodreads Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6706187593)

This is yet another breezy easy read that's super cutesy.

The Kaomgawa food detectives is about a father daughter pair who helps clients who need to identify the client's hard to find food.  Each chapter has the same formula, client comes in, the father feeds the client, the daughter takes the client back for an interview about the food, then the client comes back in and the father has made the food exactly as the client had requested, with a backstory of how the detective work happened.

The book is like that for 4 chapters, and I think I'll stop at this book for this.  The japanese series tend to have a penchant for overdoing the same style to death.  If you asked me what the difference is between the first story and the last story, other than the food, I really couldn't tell you the difference.

I'd say the premise is cute, the execution is well done, but you're really just reading the same story 4 times.  there is no character development to speak of.

So...its cute as pool reading perhaps, but I've had more interesting things to read at pools than this.  Skip.
