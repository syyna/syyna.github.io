# Hunt, Gather, Parent
[Goodreads Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6170918489)

This book is a bit of a contrast for me. I really like the lessons imparted in the book, the core tenets of which are:

1) Treat your kids more like mini adults
2) Give your kids more responsibilities, and ideally, purpose, they'll be happier and more fulfilled
3) Don't lose patience at your kids. they're freaking kids for crying out loud
4) You need a community to raise your kids. Go network, find other parents, and help parent each other kids. You are not supposed to do this by yourself as just a family unit.

that's basically the TLDR of the book. All the other stuff from the book is a bunch of anecdotes and window dressing to the main ideas. The conceit is that western society has a WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) way of raising kids, one that is very oriented to just one family unit raising a kid, making sure the kid is initialized way longer than they should, and consequently causing a bunch of downstream effects that increases stress levels on the kid, the parents, and everyone else.

Having 2 kids, I can attest to the effect that kids are definitely infantailized far longer than they should, but you have to wonder if this is a bug or a feature. Kids in other societies have to become way more useful than kids in modern western societies because they have to. When you have a family business making food, the whole family contributes to it at an early age. This is actually very true whether its western society or non-western societies as any kid of parents running a restaurant or food stand will tell you. You contribute to the restaurant at an early age, whether its grabbing vegetables to chop or taking orders. This, I would attribute mostly to an economic issue more so than western or non-western ideas of raising a kid.

The authoress gives a lot of examples of kids being raised in the Yucatan that fully cooperate with their parents, who do dishes on their own, who wake up and not fight their parents to go to school, and who are kind and sensible to everyone. And not just kids in the Yucatan, also kids from the Inuit in Alaska, and also Tanzania are also like that.

the common thread? parents take a different approach to raising their kids by treating them as adults that haven't been fully formed. So they are more patient with the kids, they treat the kids with more respect, and they don't get mad at the kids.

The reason I say this are all anecdotes is mostly because you can probably take the same view of Western ideals of raising kids and cherry pick a few families that exemplify the best ideals and have great parents that are kind and patient. Patience and impatience are universal traits. I'm sure you can find families that are far from the paramours that are described in the book and I wish the authoress would at least show examples of families that were not at their best.

The other issue I have with the book is the authoress basically takes how she raises her kid and contrast it with the parents. She raises her kid as a single parent would. Short of time, short of temper, short of everything and then contrast it with other parents in their optimal settings of community. She takes her kids to these far flung communities where she is at her least optimal and compares it to the ideal situation for the other communities. Of course the contrast is stark! Take those families and plop them down in a foreign community far away from their own support network and I most assuredly will say they will have a hard time parenting their kids too!

I still recommend the book mostly because the central ideals are great, but I believe the presentation is disingenuous. She starts the book off by saying there's no great evidence of western ideas of raising kids to be any good, but she also does NOT present her evidence of these other societies either. as we always say, the plural of anecdotes is NOT data. All the examples she has given are NOT data. They're just her observations of families in their best environments. I could easily write a book about how the western ways of raising kids are great too by cherry picking families that are successful, but that should convince no one that the western way of raising kids is the best way.

As I said, I still recommend the book because treating anyone with respect and instilling purpose is a general good way of treating anyone. kids, or adults.
Same with patience. Same with having a good support network. Those are good LIFE skills to have and not really just about raising kids.

A worthwhile read, but please keep in mind. There is no data provided in this book either.
