# God of War: Ragnarok DLC Valhalla Review

Right on the heel of finishing GoW: Ragnarok, I dived right into the DLC, Valhalla.  This DLC radically changes the game up by turning an action RPG into basically a rouge lite game.  The way they did it was by taking all the power ups that your weapons/upgrades gave you and turn them into abilities you can get on a per-run basis.

This would have made for some seriously compelling gameplay by itself, because it forces you to play with what you get rather than picking and choosing to fit your preferred method of play.  I found out some really intersting combos and other ways of killing enemies that I would never have touched if the DLC was just more of the same of the main game.  as an example, i never once used the triangle button whenever I used the chaos blades believing the move to be weak with a stupid startup time (mash triangle!).  While playing the game, this became one of my favorite moves as I watched it destroy enemies and bosses with just this one move.  

There are also some very nice combos and abilities NOT available in the game (there's a spear ability that gives you an element everytime you hit an enemy with the ranged attack, partner that up with a 30% boost in ranged attacks, and an elemental affliction overboost, and you destroy enemies from afar), and they mix up the enemy and boss varieties nicely enough so you won't get bored.

Add in a new rage attack, some new enemies that aren't in either of the GoW 2018 or Raganarok game, and you basically have a winner on the basis of mechanics alone.

Now throw in a really compelling story.  Some cool cameos from valkyries and a seriously satisfying conclusion and you have basically the game of the year for me.  The ragnarok storyline wasn't delivered the best, but valhalla is the perfect send off for that game, and possibly the entire series.

Highly recommended and satisfying! If you liked GoW, you simply cannot miss this (FREE!!) DLC.
