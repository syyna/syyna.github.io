I've been reading Berserk by Kentaro Miura on and off for about...2 decades now. I've read quite a bit of his comics, watched almost all the shows, played a few of the games, and still think that for a manga, its one of the more riveting shonen manga.

Its thus very sad for me to read his last work, and i savored every last frame of picture knowing that even if the series was finished, that the genius author/artist wouldn't be the one to have the satisfaction of finishing it.

For those who haven't read Berserk before, I won't bother summarizing this one. Suffice it to say that as the author got older, he must have sensed his own failing health and started to tie things up, but ultimately couldn't finish it. the art is still strong, the progression is still there, its no longer a monster of the week, group of monsters of the month, and the critique to the human condition is constantly there.

There's also less action, but that's fine, not every week was action packed. the artwork is still beautiful, and the dialogue sufficient.

We'll miss you Miura-san and the world is sadder that you did not get to finish your work by your own hands, but i'm sure your team and successor will do everything they can to do you proud. RIP.
