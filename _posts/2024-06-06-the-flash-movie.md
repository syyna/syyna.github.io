# The Flash
[Letterboxd Review](https://letterboxd.com/usagichann1/film/the-flash/)

When I was a kid, i was a huge fan of the Flash.  More than superman, more than green lantern, or wonderwoman, or cyborg, the flash was always the superhero I wanted to be.  I mean, his power is super speed, but he was also funny, and you know he was always playing around with the villians just becuase he could easily beat the crap out of them if he really wanted to.  He's a nice guy superhero, and he probably had the 2nd best super power (we'll ignore superman becuase you know, boy scouts are just NO FUN).

As I grew up, and graudated from the pastel hero pastiches, I kinda sorta forgot about them and it wasn't until I was well into parenthood that I started reading comics again.  This time, to my kids.  And of all the stories that I had to catch up with, the one that I thought was most interesting was the Flashpoint universe.  This is the series of crossovers where the Flash, in an attempt to undo events of the past, does a butterfly effect and creates a set of worlds that might or might not have the intended effect.  In one, Superman was never discovered as the governtment caught him before he came to his majority and he spends his life as a labrat.  In another, Aquaman is the dominant power and threatens to drown the world in tsunamis and stuff.  Batman is always present in one form or another, but even he is diminished severely in many ways (in the flashpoint universe, its bruce that died, and its the father who takes up the cowl).

Its all great stuff and reminds me of the best stories of my youth.  So it was with great anticipation that I looked at how the big screen treatment of the Flashpoint universe would turn out, and....it turned out OK.  Its servicable.  I didn't mind watching it.  But i also wouldn't watch it again.

Understandably its hard to distill something like a few hundred issues of stories into a coherent 2 hour story but they did not even get to the meat of it.  The broad strokes are there, but it seemed like they just took the characters and decided to do their own takes on it.  It could be that paying Jason Mamoa and the Wonderwoman actress would have blown the budget, but the end result was just another generic monster-of-the-week type story.  Theres the supergirl stand in for superman, there's michael keaton acting as the elder wayne as batman, and then there's two flashes.  

I can see what the director was doing, but either they ran out of time, ran out of money, or ran out of ideas.  I'd figure its all of the above.

End result, I can only recommend this if you're a huge fan of the character and the comic and don't mind a 2 hour mostly mindless popcorn movie.  I'm sure that's what the director was aiming for, but it ended up not being all that fun to watch even as a fan.

Skip.
