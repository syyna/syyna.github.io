# NightEaters
[Goodreads Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6827881696)

The best part about wandering around in the library is that sometimes you pick up some unexpected gems. This is certainly one of them. One of the best discoveries I made mid last year was of Marjorie Liu and her Monstress series, and today was another such serendipitous discovery of The Night Eaters.

What would you do if your hard ass asian parents made you go into a haunted house for a self discovery mission? That is the basics of the book, and it brings along all the tropes and such and makes it a wonderful tale of both parenting as well as how best to raise your kids. That's really just a subtext of the book, but as a parent nowadays, its the one that resonates strongest with me.

In this case, the parents are a demon and a demon eater, and their spawns are also a weird mixture of such. Except they don't know it. So they get to do humany things, like go to college, drop out of med school, play online games, and one day when Mommy decides their life is too soft, go inside of a haunted house to meet the rest of their relatives.

The story is exceptionally paced and each discovery comes with its own pleasures. You discovery the macabre and delights at the same time as the kids, and unfortunately it ends with you wanting more. I'm putting the whole series on hold with my library right now, and can't wait till I get to devour the next few books.

Highly recommend, also not for the squeamish of heart, but its so well written. =)
