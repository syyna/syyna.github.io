# Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?
[Goodreads Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7323932787)

Another year, another light novel-turned-manga I'm reading. This one has a really bad title that is mostly a catfish for young boys hoping to get some fan-service action in.

The reality is that the story is much deeper than just horny boys going into a dungeon to pick up girls. There's some structure of a level system in tied in to worship of gods who provides their followers some sort of...power? There's a little bit of complexity and thought process that goes into the world building, but much like a LOT of japanese light novel, a lot of it is just free form fantasy masturbation.

I can't say I didn't enjoy the first 3 books of it, and will probalby read the rest of it, but mostly because i want to see where the story progresses. This is no Freisian or Spice & Wolf, but I find myself needing a bit of a mental break from heavier reading material and this is just perfect for it. I'll provide another review of the rest of the series up till the last released book.

Anyway, read only if you need brain candy to munch on. There's some substance but its mostly flash.
