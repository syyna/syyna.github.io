# What If 2?
[Goodreads Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6713810007)

The first What If was an extremely fun book dealing with absurd questions that the author of XKCD gets every so often. The fact that he went through the lengths of researching and then answering the questions with as much detail as he can reminds me of an overly earnest parent answering a kid's endless supplies of whys.

and that's perhaps why the first book worked so well. This second book also works equally well, except that once you're done with the first book's schtick, you realize that this works only in short bursts. I think the author realized it as well as he tried to mix it up with some more funny cartoons and a little bit more terse answers to break up the flow.

By and large, the questions are still entertaining, although towards the end, they feel a little bit samey. Its still a good book and I don't regret the time I spent on it, but I have to admit that its not as good as the first one. Still a mild recommend by me.
