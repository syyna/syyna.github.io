# Teen Titans: Starfire
[Goodreads Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6729328655)

Starting the year out with a comic is usually not my idea of a great start, but sometimes you make do with what you've got. =)

Anyhow, continuing on the rest of the Teen Titan Series by Kami Garcia, we get to the next character, that of Starfire, and also get introduced to Cyborg as well.

This is probably the weakest of the books mostly because it does not have the chase and urgency of the other books where they're being chased by Slade Wilson. Instead, its mostly a slice of life of both Starfire and Blackfire, and their chance encounter with the rest of the teen titans.

The story probably needs to bake a wee bit longer, and it goes to show that without conflict and events, most lives are actually pretty run-of-the-mill boring. In spite of Kami Garcia's great prior success, I feel like this is either a work that needs another few hundred pages to expand, or more danger needs to be introduced.

Still, as an introduction story, its not bad. I'd like to see where the rest of the story goes, but this one does not gives me the great vibes the other 3 or 4 books had.
