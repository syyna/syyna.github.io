# The Tangleroot Palace
[Goodreads Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6484536539)

I picked up this book because I wanted a quick easy read on the plane. Seeing as how her comics' latest issues haven't yet made it into the library, I decided to see how her prose stacked up. In short, her prose is actually much more compelling than her comic form. I always find when reading monstress that somehow it would translate better to be a series of novels, and I find that reinforced when i read her writing in long form.

Its not that her ideas don't transcend words, but just that instead of it being transformed into lush background sceneries on colored paper, its described luminally instead. Tangleroot Palace seems to be a mish mash of old fairy tales given a new spin and all of them are short stories. There are several hits within the book, I'd say more hits than misses, although I found that the titular story wasn't really the strongest one.

All in all, this is a worthwhile read if any of Marjorie's comics have made you stand up. Recommended!
