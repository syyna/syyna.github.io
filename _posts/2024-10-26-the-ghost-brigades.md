# The Ghost Brigades
[Goodreads Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6955627588)

Another reread. After the ending of "Old Man's War", you basically have to jump to the next book which is this one.

This book follows the Ghost Brigades introduced in the first book, and you follow the adventures through the eye of a new protagonist, which is a clone of a traitor to the human race. He gets cloned into the body of a ghost, gets trained up, and then gets assigned to the squad that is led by the wife of the first book's protagonist (except its just the body of his wife, its a whole different brain up there).

This book shows you how the ghosts are distinctly different from normal Colonial Defense Force soldiers, in that they don't need to speak, they are more intune with their bodies, having grown up literally in it, and having no misgivings or issues since mentally they are the age of 4 or 5.

That's about the only criticism I have about the book, they talk about the real physical age of the ghosts, but unless they have also seeded maturity along with the blank personality, it almost seems impossible that they can become a crack elite fighting force in such a short amount of time. Sure, the computer fills in the blank of knowledge they do not have, but what fills in the maturity level of the soldiers? Unless they also have the personality flipped over, than in that case, why create the ghosts? A lot of questions that I probably have to read the next book about.

In any case, the plot is fairly good, the story moves along quite nicely, and a lot of loose ends are tied up neatly. This book is definitely one of those books that moves you along and asks you to not please use your brain too much.

With such a well written universe, i'm more than grateful to turn my brain off for the 3 hour or so it took me to finish the book.

Highly recommended!
