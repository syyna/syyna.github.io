# Vagabond - Vizbig Vol. 5-12
[Goodreads Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7558473802)

Finally finished all the volumes available at my Library, and i think according to amazon at least, i've caught up to whats released for the English versions.

The comic is still moving along at a good pace, and the two characters are moving along towards a conclusion of sorts. Each of the main character has had their challenges and overcome them and now they've mostly moved in opposite directions, with Musashi going towards the path of a farmer and helping out a small farm and Kojiro going towards that of a pampered swordmaster.

Its going to be interesting to see how the two storylines intersect, but it seems like the author knows what he's doing to move towards the conclusion of the storyline. As with all comics that are on-going this is a bit of a frustration for me, but its ok, I just hope the series finishes before I do. =)

Still recommended! the art and topics is definitely still in the young men category, but its well done and the pacing still feels right.
