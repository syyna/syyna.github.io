# Sonic2: The Movie
[LetterboxD Review](https://letterboxd.com/usagichann1/film/sonic-the-hedgehog-2/)

Immediately after watching the first Sonic the Hedgehog (2020), me and my boy jumped into watching Sonic 2. Much like the videogames, Sonic 2 introduces the character of Tails, and just like the first Sonic, Tails is a joy to watch. From his signature tails binding together to form a helicopter rotor system, to his admiration of Sonic.

Sonic himself did not change much from the first movie, he's still a teenager, still cocksure, brash, but charming, and fast fast fast.

The star of the movie however, is still Dr. Robotnik, and I can say this is one of Jim Carrey's best performance in a decade or two.

All in all, a great kid's movie and everything its advertised to be. Highly recommended if you've got kids and you want to introduce them to Sonic!
