# Kowloon Generic Romance Vol 6 - 12
[Goodreads Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7558470567)

This reviews up to Vol 7 - 12, which was the latest available at my library.

The manga turned into a bit of a scifi premise, which I figured it was headed towards anyway, but to see it turn out makes me feel a bit uneasy. The scifi portions of it is fairly light, and there's a bit of a central mystery, but I'm afraid the turns are just not very interesting. The authoress is either slow playing the central mystery, or have run out of ideas to move the plot forward.

I think fundementally, its mostly that the background is interesting, but is not strong enough to be a central character in the series. The charactesr are interesting but not so much so that they can make up for the lack of a plot. i kinda now know why no one can make a "slice of life" comic or series last more than 5 chapters or so. Real life really is that boring! Its designed to be! If real life was exciting, we'd probably end up dying or something. Boring means you live another day. seeking excitement sometimes means risking your life. Biologically speaking, no long lasting species is really risk seeking because it just doesn't make reproductive sense.

With that said, I'll continue reading becuase the premise is still intriguging and I want to see how the authoress spins this. I don't have great hopes and still think "After the Rain" is a much better book.

Mild recommend.
