# Sonic1: The Movie
[LetterboxD Review](https://letterboxd.com/usagichann1/film/sonic-the-hedgehog/)

My kid is starting to get into Sonic from the various Youtube Kids shorts he watch, and I thought why not watch the movie? I've seen a few screeners of it from a few different places and it looked interesting.

I have to say, this blew away any expectations I had. I was thinking of a movie much like the Mario Brothers movie, but this has way more depth, emotions, and Jim Carrey freaking stole the entire movie.

Make no mistake, Sonic is the hero, but without Jim Carrey as a credible Mr. Robotnik, the entire movie would have been pretty boring.

Watch this if you remember the heyday of Jim Carrey, he's back and in a great way! Oh, there's a blue Hedgehog too...
