The game is a bit on the easy side, especially if you've got any experience with 3d platformers (any of the modern Marios), but oh my god, the game is a love letter to the last 20 years of gaming.  There's definitely going to be something you're familiar with here, whether its from 1st party Sony properties like Uncharted, Last of Us, God of War, or Spiderman, or 3rd party properties like Castlevania, Metal Gear Solid, or Street Fighter.  

Basically any franchise or property that has showed up on a Sony console before is shown some love in this game. 

The game itself is a really fun platformer, a bigger version of Astro's Playroom on the PS5, but they've streamlined a lot of the game.  You no longer have to zip up Astro's suit, or any of the make work that they did to showcase the controller or capabilities of the PS5.  Its mostly pure game here and even though the variety of suits aren't as large as you'd expect, they definitely make the most of them.

I just wish that they'd made some of the stuff they did in the finale into more of the game itself.  Turning a platfomer into a bit of a 3d shoot-em-up is pretty good, and I wish they had done more of that.

All in all, a really good game. Highly recommended!
