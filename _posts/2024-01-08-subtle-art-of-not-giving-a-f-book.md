# The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck
[Goodreads Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6138404569)

This book is mostly a bro-version of Buddhism. Don't care too much about things, care just enough about the things that matter, filter out what matters to you, be even keeled good or bad. Those are the core tenements of buddhism and is basically what the author repeats in this book. The rest of the book is mostly window dressing, all the swear words don't really add much to the book, but I can see that for a given audience it makes it more real or authentic.

Doesn't really work for me, but I have to say its a good philosophy to live by IF you can live by it. I'm at the age now where I believe some people are just wired differently and all the books you read and advice you get doesn't really help. Some things are just biological no matter how much you want it to be different (ie, height, skin color, for the obvious ones, but other non obvious ones can be sense of humor, wit, etc). and philosophy is no different.

In the end, read this only if you really want a refresher in basic buddhist philosphies and don't mind a bro way of it.

its a meh to me. take it or leave it for this book.
