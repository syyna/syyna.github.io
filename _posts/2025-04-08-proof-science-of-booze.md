# Proof: The Science of Booze
[Goodreads Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7467172761)

I've had this book in my audible for quite a long time and never got around to reading it. This was quite a few years ago when I was still capable of holding my alcohol.

Anyway, this was a fun romp into the science of how booze was made. From beer, to wine, to rice wint, it goes into both the science portions of it, with interesting stories of how some breweries perhaps inadvertently created a bit of a mold scare in some neighborhoods, to how we, as a species and certain socieities enjoy our alcohol. It goes into a little about how alcohol affects the human body and goes into small details about the recent health benefits of alcohol (there are none), and that enjoying alcohol is mostly that we're allowed to lose control of our faculties for a few hours at a time.

All in all, the book is well written, but there're some unresolved threads (they never found out what was cuasing the mold in the community with the brewery, but they're still investigating), but given that this isn't a whodunnit, its much more forgiveable.

Mild recommend if you like drinking, it doesn't go super hard into one particular topic or another, but you might as well enjoy the science behind the drink you do enjoy!
