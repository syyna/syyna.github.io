# The Pig, the Snake, and The Piegon
[Letterboxd Review](https://letterboxd.com/usagichann1/film/the-pig-the-snake-and-the-pigeon/)

I watched this because the wife recommended this and you know, you're on a plane with a 5 year old, what else are you going to do?

This is a movie about how the #3 most wanted crimninal decides to get rid of both #2 and #1 in an attempt to make some meaning of his life.  After a life of crime and being reduced to being permanently in hiding, the #3 criminal gets a diagnosis of stage 4 lung cancer and is encouraged to turn himself in.

while that is happening, he notices that he is just #3 on the list of most wanted and decides to turn himself in only after he gets rid of #2 and #1.  So then begins his quest of redemption, and the allegorical quest of who the pig, the snake, and the piegon are in the movie.

That's the movie in a nut shell. Its billed as a dark comedy, but there's really nothing very funny about the novie, and you're mostly in a character study of "if you were a wanted criminal, is this really the best way to make your mark in the world?".  

I watched it for what it is, some directoral commentary on the state of life and how we are all but transient passengers on it, muddying our way to some after life that might or might not be true.

That statement is mostly bullshit, in the way the points that the movie tries to make. =)

I'd say this movie is a skip.  The director tries to make some greater point, but I feel like he just constantly misses.  The film itself is well executed, but that's no reason to blow 2 hours of your life.  Skip unless the title in its chinese form catches your philosophical eye.
