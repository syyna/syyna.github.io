# Dune - Part 2 (2024)
[Letterboxd Review](https://letterboxd.com/usagichann1/film/inside-out-2-2024/)

This being a back to back watch from Dune: Part One, was a fast continuation from the first movie.  The movie basically picks up from where the last movie left off, and you have the continued stories of the Director's vision.

Its still interesting and enthralling, but this is where you can start criticizing the world that Frank Herbert built.  You see the protagonist grow more confident in his powers, you see his new evil rival, you see the machinations of the rest of the universe. 

Its still hauntingly beaI watched this with my 11 year old daughter and one of her many BFFs.

The premise hasn't changed that much from Inside Out 1, but the times have changed, and this time Riley is now a teenager undergoing puberty.

Along with that, they introduce new characters such as Anxiety, Nostalgia, and Embarrasment and Envy.

For the most part, the movie focuses on Anxiety and Embarrasment, and tracking with my own High school expereince, that's pretty much accurate. Some folks experience less of each, but its fair to say that for the microsom that is high school, anxiety and embarrasment pretty much rues the day for much of the denizens of High school.

The movie is of typical Pixar quality but I have to say I'm much less enthralled as I was in Inside Out 1, when the characters and their minds were introduced. The situations was more of a "been there, down that" situation, and the main characters such as disgust and fear plays much more of a backseat than they did in inside out 1, much to the detriment of the movie, i thought.

Still, it gave me a focus for which to think about how to guide my own brat daughter through the next phase of her life so its apt and timely to my own puporses. 

Still a highly recommened movie...just don't compare it overly much to Pixar's last work and its own prequel.utiful, and the actors and everyone behind them deliver in spades, but its still a poor allegory of the world.  

Its still absolutely worth watching but at the same time you realize its such a poor substitute for what our world is going through in 2024.

Highly recommended if you've watched the first one, and if you haven't seen the first one, go and watch it.  You won't regret the 3 hours you spend.
