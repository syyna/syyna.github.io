# Ghost of Tsushima

A stub review:

* Very close to Witcher 3
* Game is beautiful
* A bit of a chore towards the end
* No challenge once you get half the skills, all ghost skills makes the game even easier and you need to challenge yourself to make it harder, even at the hardest difficulty level
* Game story kinda makes no sense, they try to make it like Kurosawa, but it fails.  All the looks, none of the story, none of the real emotional stories.
*  Tried too hard to fit all the biomes into a small game.
